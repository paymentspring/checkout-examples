To include a {{ include.type }} on a page, you will need a checkout form-id. Once you have a form-id, paste this javascript into your site where you would like the form to appear:

```markdown
<script src="https://checkout.paymentspring.com/js/paymentspring.js" formId="cb7eae32763131ade35f"></script>
```
Where `cb7eae32763131ade35f` is replaced with your form-id.
